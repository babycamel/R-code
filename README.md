# R-code

I will put various pieces of R-code that I have been working on here.

circle.R is a statistical joke, so just a bit of fun that I cam up with a few years ago. Perhaps some people will get it.

The other files are either epidemiological models or optimal control models and soon some code for solving differential games.

scafit.R fits an epidemiological compartmental model for the parasitic disease psoroptes ovis using some data that I have put together from public sources.
